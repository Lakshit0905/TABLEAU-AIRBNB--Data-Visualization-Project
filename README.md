# TABLEAU| AIRBNB Data Visualization 

Project Description:

We would like to explore the business secrets behind this success. More guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a personalized way. Moreover, we need to grasp different methods of data visualization to express these interesting insights efficiently.  

The listings excel of Seattle Airbnb dataset includes almost 74 variables including host and house descriptions, different prices, geographic information, order availability, and review scores, which are enough to cover our course targets. So, we can practice visualization techniques during project processes. These are some guiding questions for our analysis:

•	How do price listings vary under different locations?
•	What are different types of properties in Seattle and how do they vary as per the neighborhood?
•	What kind of properties and neighborhoods are highly rated?
•	How review scores impact the pricing and availability?
•	What are important features for customers?
•	Do regular hosts and super hosts have different cancellation and booking policies?

Hypothesis:
There are some hypotheses related to guiding questions. They need to be tested:
 
•	Daily prices can be higher for properties with better house conditions.
•	Properties in the best locations charge the highest daily prices.
•	Strict cancellation policies are best for properties with high review scores.
